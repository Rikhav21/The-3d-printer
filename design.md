# Day one
## Research
Today I spent a lot of time looking an=t a lot of different options and at the end I decided on making a core XY machine. I looked through a lot of different models on printables and I think I got the basic principles of how one of these machines would work.
## My goal
My goal with this 3d printer is to 3d print as many of the parts as possible from the frame, to whatever crosses my mind. I also feel like a auto print remover would be something simple to add with just a servo, that would make the printer way cooler.
## Design
I started with onshape, and got a liitle of the gantry done. 
## time
4 hours 30 minutes
